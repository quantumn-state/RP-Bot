**Privacy Policy for RP Bot**

This Privacy Policy explains how RP Bot ("the Bot") collects, uses, and protects user data. By using the Bot, you agree to the practices outlined below.

### 1. **Data Collection**

- **Message Content**:  
  The Bot may interact with messages or commands you send in Discord, but it does **not** log or store the content of any messages.
  
- **User Information**:  
  The Bot may temporarily access your Discord username, user ID, server ID, and roles to provide its services. However, no personal information (such as real names or email addresses) is collected or stored by the Bot.

### 2. **Data Usage**

- **Providing Services**:  
  Any data the Bot accesses is used solely to provide functionality (e.g., responding to commands) and is not stored or shared.
  
- **No Third-Party Sharing**:  
  The Bot does not share user data with any third parties. All data interactions occur within the Discord platform.

### 3. **Data Security**

- **Data Retention**:  
  The Bot does not retain or store any user data beyond the duration of the session. Once interactions are completed, no data is saved.

- **Security Measures**:  
  While the Bot does not store data, all interactions take place on Discord’s platform, which employs its own security protocols to protect user privacy.

### 4. **User Responsibilities**

- **Sensitive Information**:  
  Do not share any sensitive or personal information through the Bot. The Bot is designed for roleplay purposes, and all interactions should follow Discord’s guidelines and your local laws.

### 5. **Third-Party Links and Content**

- **Discord Platform**:  
  The Bot operates within Discord, and as such, you should also refer to Discord’s own privacy policy to understand how your data is handled by Discord.

### 6. **Changes to this Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be reflected here, and continuing to use the Bot after changes are made constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.

### 7. **Contact**

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, you can reach out to the Bot’s creators at quantumn.state@gmail.com.
